In this project i display several boxes based on boxes.js Array.
Elements on this array contains:
<ul>
<li>ID - which is the number of the box<li/>
<li> on - which is true if the box is black or false if the box has transparent color<li/>
<ul/>

I use react useState to change the box color when I clicked on the box
